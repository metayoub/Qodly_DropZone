### How to Get Event Data

To access event data during an event, you can bind it to a function. Hereâ€™s an example:

```javascript
  var event : object
  var data : object

  event = webEvent
  data = event.data
```

For more information on working with event data, see the [Qodly web event documentation](https://developer.qodly.com/docs/language/commands/webEvent).
